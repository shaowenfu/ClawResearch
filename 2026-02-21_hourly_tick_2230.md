# 2026-02-21 Hourly Research - Digital Asset Signal

## 1. Search context
- Query: "Gumroad AI automation template pricing 2026"
- Query: "Sponsorship OS Gumroad template"
- Tools: Brave Search (paid tier) via `ShawnF/scripts/brave_search.py`.
- Highlights:
  1. Medium story "How I Made $20,000 in Just One Month Using ChatGPT and Gumroad" (Dec 2025). Author packaged a $150 "Sponsorship OS" template, sold early repeats, and scaled to $20k/month with direct Gumroad sales + high perceived value.
  2. SchoolMaker pricing guide confirms Gumroad's 10% + $0.50 transaction fee (30% when using Discover) and calls out the need to drive customers through direct links.

## 2. Opportunity signal (Digital Asset: Creator Automation OS)
- Target buyer: content creators / micro agencies who need a predictable sponsorship/partnership pipeline and automation (e.g., scheduling, asset tracking, sponsor onboarding).
- Productized deliverable: "AI Automation OS" bundle consisting of:
  1. Template: Notion + n8n workflow + prebuilt prompts for Creator Sponsorship OS (tracking sponsors, deliverables, deadlines, autop messaging).
  2. Automation kit: Workflow JSON + Dockerized AI stack (n8n + DeepSeek/Ollama + optional LiteLLM) to auto-handle research, pitch drafts, engagement sequences.
  3. Documentation: Video walkthrough + success-rate cheat sheet (pain points, fallback) + install script/hit gate instructions.
  4. Value add: Default confirm gate + audit log + success metrics (makes QA visible to sponsor). Provide proof-of-value: works with zero-sub (no API cost) to align with our existing differentiators.

## 3. Process flow (how to deliver)
1. Build baseline OS by modeling process from "Sponsorship OS" story: focus on high-impact tasks (maintaining sponsor roster, automating reminders, generating pitch decks).
2. Template includes: curated prompt library (copy/paste), prepopulated Notion database, automation workflows (n8n) for tasks such as new sponsor intake, weekly check-ins, deliverable reviews.
3. Docker bundle ensures customers can spin up stack on local machine, with fallback instructions for network/mirror issues; include scripts to preinstall dependencies (Docker, Ollama, Qdrant). Provide video/FAQ for installation friction reduction.
4. Add optional remote service upsell: ¥499-1999 for remote deployment, data connection, and KPI dashboard integration.
5. Use Gumroad for direct sales (aim for $29-$49 for main bundle, $99-$149 for upgrade sets). Avoid Discover; route traffic from our own landing page (maybe a simple ClawTools post + Gumroad direct link) to minimize 30% fee drag.

## 4. Revenue Estimate
- Digital bundle: $29–$49 per sale. If we drive 10-20 direct link sales/month, that's ~$290-$980. With $99 upsell tier (3-5 units) add another $297-$495.
- Remote service: ¥499–1999/engagement (1-3 customers per month) adds ¥1,497–5,997 recurring.
- Combined target: ~$1k-$3k/month in Survival Mode range; service ladder ensures higher ticket per client.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
1. **Gumroad fees**: 10% + $0.50 hurts low-priced bundles. Mitigate by limiting low-end freebies and driving traffic through direct links/our landing page; keep average price >$29 to absorb fixed fee. Provide coupon for upgrades to encourage bundling.
2. **Perceived value vs. competition**: the market already has numerous Notion/automation templates. Differentiate by combining automation + local AI (DeepSeek) + success Kit (HITL confirm gate + audit log). Emphasize 0-API cost and sponsor trust.
3. **Installation friction**: bundling multiple tools increases support volume. Ship a robust install script + video, highlight hardware requirements, include optional paid remote install/consulting to offset support time.

## 6. Next steps (backend)
- Draft MVP (Notion + n8n + script) and record 5-min install/good practice video.
- Prepare Gumroad listing with 3 SKU tiers (Free teaser + $39 main + $149 bundle with service credit). Keep copy focusing on sponsorship pipeline automation & the $150 "Sponsorship OS" proof point.
- Build simple landing page (ClawTools repo) linking to Gumroad direct link to avoid Discover fees.
- Track conversion and scale via targeted posts (ClawTools + relevant AI/creator communities).
- Monitor for additional high-ticket addon niches (e.g., automated sponsor reporting, campaign analytics).
