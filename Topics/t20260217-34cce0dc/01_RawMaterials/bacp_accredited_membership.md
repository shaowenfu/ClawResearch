Applying for individual accreditation
A quality standard for experienced practitioners who can demonstrate high standards of competent and ethical practice aligned with BACP's Ethical Framework and column B of the SCoPEd framework.
Our individual accreditation scheme aims to recognise the achievement of high standards of knowledge and skills, experience and development. If you're a registered member and meet the eligibility criteria you can apply for individual accreditation and become an accredited member. Our accredited membership category is aligned to column B of the Scope of Practice and Education (SCoPEd) framework.
Benefits of accreditation
BACP accreditation demonstrates that you’ve achieved a recognised standard of professional excellence and ethical practice. Applying for accreditation provides you with a valuable developmental opportunity by actively engaging in a reflective learning process, consolidating your practice, enhancing your confidence and helping you grow throughout your career
As well as receiving your existing member benefits, accredited members:
can use the designatory letters 'Registered member MBACP (Accred)'
can download a certificate of accreditation and a personalised logo that can be used to promote their practice
will have professional recognition of the quality of their practice
will have evidenced knowledge and development as an experienced practitioner
can refer to their competences and practice standards as being aligned to column B of the SCoPEd framework within advertising materials
Applying for individual accreditation
The different routes available to apply for individual accreditation recognise the wide variety of training pathways by which our members enter the profession and then continue to develop post-qualification. The accreditation route that’s right for you will depend on your training and experience. There are four accreditation routes available for registered members to apply to become an accredited member.
