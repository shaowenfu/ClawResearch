BACP Register
What is the BACP Register?
The BACP Register is a public record of counsellors and psychotherapists who meet or exceed our recommended quality standards. These standards cover training, supervision, continuing professional development and a contractual commitment to our Ethical Framework.
It was the first psychological therapists' register to be accredited under the Professional Standards Authority's accredited register programme. This government-backed scheme aims to protect the public by helping them to choose health and care professionals who are competent and trustworthy.
The PSA Accredited Register scheme only applies within the UK and has no jurisdiction in either British Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories.
