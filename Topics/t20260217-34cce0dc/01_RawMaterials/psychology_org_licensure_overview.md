FAQ
Are you planning to become a licensed psychologist? Learn about the licensure process and how to meet your state’s specific psychologist licensure requirements.
While each state sets its own rules for psychology licensure, most require that prospective psychologists complete similar processes. Generally, to become a psychologist, you need to earn a doctorate, complete supervised experience requirements, and pass exams. Use this guide to walk you through the common steps and help you prepare for your state’s specific requirements.
Different Types of Psychology Licenses
Clinical psychology,child psychology, and school psychology are some of the most common psychology licenses. Each license type differs by scope of practice and state-specific requirements for education, supervised experience, and examinations.
You must earn a doctorate in psychology, either a Ph.D. or Psy. D., to practice independently and to provide assessment, diagnosis, psychotherapy, counseling, and testing. However, in some states, individuals with a master’s degree in psychology or a related field may practice under supervision. Many schools offer undergraduate and graduate online psychology degrees, but licensure generally requires a doctorate from an accredited in-person program.
Aspiring psychologists should plan to complete approximately 2,000 hours during their doctoral internship and another 2,000 hours of postdoc experience to meet most state licensure requirements. All state boards require applicants for licensure to pass the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP), and some states may also ask for an oral or jurisprudence exam.

How Do I Get a Psychologist License?
Licensing regulations differ by state, but you generally need a doctorate in psychology, clinical experience, and passing scores on the EPPP and any state-specific exams. The total time from earning your undergraduate and graduate degrees to meeting state licensure requirements can take 8-12 years.
Step 1: Earn a Doctorate
The majority of states require a Psy.D. or Ph.D. in psychology from a regionally accredited school. In some states, candidates for licensure must hold a doctorate from a program accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA).
Step 2: Pass the EPPP and State-Specific Examination
Candidates for psychologist licensure in all states must pass the EPPP, a standardized, computer-based test that evaluates knowledge across eight content areas and readiness for independent practice. In addition to the EPPP, some states may require a jurisprudence exam and/or oral examination. The jurisprudence exam will cover state-specific laws, regulations, and ethics for psychology practice.
Step 3: Gain Required Experience, if Applicable
Students typically complete an internship as part of their doctoral requirements, followed by a post-doctoral clinical experience. The total number of supervised hours can range from 1,500 to 6,000 hours, depending on state requirements for your psychology specialization.
Step 4: Apply for State Psychology Licensure
You should familiarize yourself with your state’s specific licensure requirements early in your psychology studies. After meeting all requirements, you can submit your application along with any requested transcripts, personal and professional background information, and fees to your state’s licensing board for final approval.
Educational Requirements for a Psychology License
You need to hold a Psy.D. or Ph.D. in psychology to qualify for licensure in most states. Although some programs may require a master’s degree, most offer direct-entry pathways for bachelor’s degree holders or award a master’s along the way to the doctorate. Most doctoral programs look for candidates with excellent grades in relevant coursework and evidence of research experience.
Bachelor’s in Psychology
While you may not necessarily need a bachelor’s degree in psychology to enter a doctoral program, this degree offers a strong foundation in psychological concepts and research methods, providing essential skills and content knowledge for rigorous graduate work.
A bachelor’s degree typically requires 120 credits completed over four years. If you plan to become a licensed psychologist, a bachelor’s degree prepares you for advanced graduate study. Even if you do not want to enter direct clinical practice, a bachelor’s degree equips you with versatile skills applicable to various careers in psychology-related fields. Those with a bachelor’s degree in psychology often work as case managers, career counselors, marketing researchers, and human resource specialists.
Master’s in Psychology
A master’s in psychology takes 1-3 years to complete, depending on whether you enroll full-time, part-time, or in an accelerated or online program. Although a master’s can pave the way to doctoral studies and state licensure, some graduates move directly into positions as therapists, counselors, human resources directors, and social service managers. A master’s can also prepare you for non-clinical careers in fields like industrial-organizational psychology and forensic psychology.
Although most states require a doctorate for licensure, some allow individuals with a master’s degree to conduct psychology services under supervision or with a restricted scope of practice.
Accreditation is a key factor when choosing a master’s program. Accreditation ensures that a school meets established academic standards and qualifies students for federal financial aid. Programmatic accreditation, awarded to psychology programs within a school, can affect licensure eligibility and employment opportunities.
While the APA Commission on Accreditation (APA-CoA) does not accredit master’s programs, the Master’s in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC) accredits master’s programs in psychology and counseling, and the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) accredits graduate degrees in school psychology.
Ph.D. in Psychology or Psy.D.
Ph.D. and Psy.D. degrees both require coursework, a practicum experience, and a dissertation or applied project. Earning a Ph.D. or Psy.D. usually takes five to six years. Although both degrees provide clinical training, the Ph.D. emphasizes scientific research, leading to multiple career paths in academia, research, and clinical settings. The Psy.D. is more of a practice-oriented degree, primarily preparing students to deliver direct clinical services.
Attending an APA-accredited program, whether you choose a Ph.D. or Psy.D. degree, ensures academic quality and indicates your readiness for practice. Accreditation is essential for licensure, financial aid eligibility, and employment. Although the APA does not accredit online Ph.D. or Psy.D. programs, some accredited doctoral programs offer online courses.
Examination Requirements for Psychologist Licensure
The EPPP determines your eligibility for licensure. The computer-based exam consists of 225 multiple-choice questions that cover the core areas of psychology, including research methods, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and ethics. You generally need to score 500 or higher, although passing score requirements may vary by state.
The registration fee for the EPP Part 1 exam, which tests foundational knowledge, is $600 plus a non-refundable $87 test center fee. The fee for Part 2, which focuses on practical skills, is $450. Some state licensing boards do not require the Part 2 exam.
Experience Requirements for a Psychology License
Most states require a specific number of internship hours during the doctoral program and at least a year-long post-doctoral experience. Total required hours range from 1,500 to 6,000 or more.
A handful of states do not require postdoc experience. Requirements may also differ for various specialties and license types, such as clinical psychology, school psychology, and some master’s-level mental health licenses. Consult the Associate of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) for current information on experience requirements for your state.
Frequently Asked Questions
CollapsedExpand All
What is the purpose of licensure in psychology?
Licensure in psychology serves the public’s best interests, ensuring competency through education, training, and examination requirements. The licensure process helps limit the practice of psychology to qualified and vetted professionals, establishes high standards of practice, and upholds legal and ethical standards and accountability.
What qualifications do you need to be a psychologist?
In most states, to receive approval to practice as a licensed psychologist, you need to earn a doctorate in psychology from an accredited institution, fulfill a specific number of supervised clinical experience hours, and pass the EPPP exam and any state-specific jurisprudence or other required exams.
How much do psychologists make?
Annual earnings for psychologists range from $54,860 to $157,330, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Salaries vary widely based on years of experience, specialty, and type of employer. Psychologists working in government agencies, ambulatory health care services, and local, state, and private hospitals earned the highest salaries.
Can you be a psychologist without a Ph.D.?
In most cases, you need a doctorate and a state license to call yourself a psychologist or practice independently. While a master’s can qualify you for certain mental health careers, such as a licensed marriage and family therapist or a licensed professional clinical counselor, these roles have a more limited scope of practice.
