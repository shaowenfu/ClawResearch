Applying for individual accreditation
A quality standard for experienced practitioners who can demonstrate high standards of competent and ethical practice aligned with BACP's Ethical Framework and column B of the SCoPEd framework.
Our individual accreditation scheme aims to recognise the achievement of high standards of knowledge and skills, experience and development. If you're a registered member and meet the eligibility criteria you can apply for individual accreditation and become an accredited member. Our accredited membership category is aligned to column B of the Scope of Practice and Education (SCoPEd) framework.
Benefits of accreditation
BACP accreditation demonstrates that you’ve achieved a recognised standard of professional excellence and ethical practice. Applying for accreditation provides you with a valuable developmental opportunity by actively engaging in a reflective learning process, consolidating your practice, enhancing your confidence and helping you grow throughout your career

can use the designatory letters 'Registered member MBACP (Accred)'

will have evidenced knowledge and development as an experienced practitioner
can refer to their competences and practice standards as being aligned to column B of the SCoPEd framework within advertising materials
Applying for individual accreditation
The different routes available to apply for individual accreditation recognise the wide variety of training pathways by which our members enter the profession and then continue to develop post-qualification. The accreditation route that’s right for you will depend on your training and experience. There are four accreditation routes available for registered members to apply to become an accredited member.

What is the BACP Register?
The BACP Register is a public record of counsellors and psychotherapists who meet or exceed our recommended quality standards. These standards cover training, supervision, continuing professional development and a contractual commitment to our Ethical Framework.
It was the first psychological therapists' register to be accredited under the Professional Standards Authority's accredited register programme. This government-backed scheme aims to protect the public by helping them to choose health and care professionals who are competent and trustworthy.
The PSA Accredited Register scheme only applies within the UK and has no jurisdiction in either British Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories.
